This piece of research was developed during the second trimestre of the Sound and Music Computing master programme at the MTG (Universitat Pompeu Fabra). To follow the different codes, I am now providing a roadmap for better understanding. Likewise, take into consideration that the needed data is called in each code from a subdirectory call 'datasets' where all the audio clips must be saved, on their respective subdirectories.

So that, the codes correspond to:

Code 2: Foleiss et al. algorithm
Code 3: Cai et al. algorithm
Code 4: Foleiss et al. algorithm + chroma features
Code 5: Foleiss et al. algorithm + chroma features + flatness standard deviation and harmonic mean
Code 6: Robustness test by adding noise
Code 7: Rosubstness test by adding echo
Code 8: Foleiss et al. algorithm for period classification
Code 9: Foleiss et al. algorithm + chroma features + flatness standard deviation and harmonic mean + silent rate feature
Code 10: Foleiss et al. algorithm + chroma features + flatness standard deviation and harmonic mean + silent rate feature + Gabor filters


In order to run the codes, select your cointaining directory where you have your own dataset!
